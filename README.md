- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (job photos)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages (static file serving)

Supabase project ID: `jmsrlhqbzstuczxilxua`

## Deploying

No build step. All files are static.

**GitHub Pages:** Settings > Pages > Source: main branch, root folder.

**Cloudflare Pages:** Connect repo, leave build command and publish directory blank.

Any push to main redeploys automatically on either platform.

---

## Database Setup

The schema is in `faithlock_schema.sql` (run once in Supabase SQL Editor to create all tables, indexes, and RLS policies). Sample data is in `sample_data.sql`.

After running the schema:
1. Create two auth users in Supabase dashboard > Authentication > Users
2. Insert their UUIDs into `user_profiles` (instructions in the schema file)
3. Insert tech names into the `techs` table

## POC Limitations

The current build is a proof of concept with the following known gaps that must be resolved before go-live with real data:

**Shared tech login** - all field techs share one Supabase auth account. Job filtering and lead tech enforcement are disabled. Fix: create individual auth accounts per tech and update `assigned_tech_ids` and `lead_tech_id` to store auth UUIDs.

**Account instructions** - saved to browser localStorage, not the database. Not visible across devices. Fix: add an `instructions` text column to the `accounts` table and update the save/load calls in `accounts.html`.

**Unit costs on tech submissions** - line items inserted from the tech view store `unit_cost: 0`. Admin sees correct costs via the reference catalog during review. Fix: pass unit cost from the catalog at insert time on the tech side.

## Go-Live Prerequisites

Full checklist is in `docs/FaithLock_WorkingDoc_v2.1.docx`, Section 9. Short version:

- Individual auth accounts created for Milton, Zach, and Thomas
- POC limitations above resolved
- Default passwords changed
- Real accounts, parts, job types, and labor rates entered in Reference Data
- QuickBooks export tested and confirmed with Brenda
- All techs confirmed on capable mobile browsers
- Supabase project and GitHub repo transferred to Faith Lock account
